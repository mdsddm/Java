/*  3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.
Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2)
between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:
a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcabcab"
Output: 1
Explanation:
The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
